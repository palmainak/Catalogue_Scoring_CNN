Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model for Catalog Scoring

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed for catalog scoring, specifically to predict the relevance or quality of items in a catalog. 

1) At first we have collected dataset from Kaggle.
2) Then we trained the model using the train dataset of 60,000 items.
3) Next we evaluated the trained model using the test dataset of 10,000 items to assess its performance metrics such as value loss, value accuracy, etc.

This model can be used in multiple sectors like banking sector, hospitality management, institute portals, etc.


We collected the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist
Train Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist#fashion-mnist_train.csv
Test Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist#fashion-mnist_test.csv
